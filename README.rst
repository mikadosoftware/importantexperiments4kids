:desc: Great experiments of the past - with added children!

====================
Experiments and kids
====================

::

  Kids need to *do* the great experiments of the past to understand how we built today.
  Because they will have to build tomorrow. 

The history of technology has made humanity who it is, each advance in
technology changing what we believed possible - and each such change
has been the result of *scientific experimentation* - a clear,
definitive, unarguable demonstration of a new world we previously
could not see.

How we got here is important - and every child should have the opportunity 
to understand how humanity thought before those experiments came along - for 
we can be sure humanity is going to have to change its mind again and again 
this century.

So, this is a little bridge linking the past and the future - a means
for everyday parents to encourage discovery and experimentalism in
their children - and *at the same time* enrich our relationships with
our children.

Of course, thats if we can understand the calculus :-)


What do I do?
-------------

If you can contribute to an experiment - please add one in through the
pull request mechanism).  Ideally we want to see youtube videos of
successful how-tos

Restrictions
------------

Obviously there are age related restrictions, some safety and some
practicality restrictions - but I would hope that these experiments
are not limited to Father and son in the garage - I would hope we will
see some of these using school or public premises (with all suitable
permissions) in time

Is it difficult?
----------------

To be fair most of we parents will get stuck once the experiments need
calculus, but don't worry our kids can explain that to us !

Do I have to go back to school?  Well, not really - and that is I hope
one of the benefits of a online community - we can sneakily ask for
help without our kids listening in.

So what is this?
----------------

This is just a listing of experiments - what to do, how to do it and
what to learn.

It will grow in time.


Pre-history
-----------

* Fire
* Shelter
* Cutting Edges
* Food
* Clothing
* Travel
* Trade

Civilisation
------------

* Bronze
* Leather
* Trade and the Romans
* Infrastructure and Romans
* Iron and Song dynasty


There is a lot of intertwined sweeping history and technology above.  
And plenty of the "civlisation" era encompasses some of the great 
experiments - Erastothenes and the size of the Earth for example.

Science
-------

* Size of the Earth (Eratothenes, Ptolemy) - why it mattered to Columbus
  http://www.ciocookbook.com/philosophy/business_case.html

* Distance of the Moon

* Speed of Light (Jupiters moons or Michelson )

* Making a fire from wood (basic ember and notch, with bow.)

* Cannonballs and calculus

* microscope to view cells dividing

* Telescope to see a crater on the moon and work out distance to moon

* growing peas or fruti flies for genetics.

* Anything by Lavoisier, Boyle, Pascal, Davy, Faraday :-)

Maker-stuff
-----------

* the particle dectector - smoke filled container and radioactive material
  (Yes I think I am wondering off course here)

* Background microwave radiation

* Robots

* Satellite imagery

* launching balloon into space

Next steps
----------

I do want to make this happen - and am unsure if I can find the huge
well of energey to lift it to self-sustaining by myself.

So if you like the idea and want to get involved please submit 


The format of experiments
-------------------------

An experiment is best formatted as below::


  Name:: Calculating the size of the Earth

  History::
        <some notes on Erastothenes and why Columbus wanted to 
         sail round the world>

  Age group:: 
        7+ (Mathematics is fairly simple algebra and degrees)

  Requirements::

     XXX
        
  Options

      COntact with schools in equatorial climes may be useful for 
      encvouraging inter-community links and getting readings of 
      their sun declination and distance from "us"

  Method

      XXX
