Making fire
===========

  Name:: Making fire from primitive beginnings

  History::
        You could argue that the ability to make fire was the discovery
        that really put humans near the top of the animal survival charts.
        Along with sourcing clean water, clothing and shelter, it's
        considered a useful survival skill, and a great way to demonstrate
        some basic principles.

  Age group::
        5+, but with adult supervision - there's cutting and fire involved

  Requirements::
        Access to small bits of dry timber
        A small round bit of dry timber (like a dowel rod)
        Some cotton wool (makes great kindling)
        A green (fresh) stick from a tree, anywhere between 30cm and 60cm long (TODO : revise)
        Some fibrous material to make a cord from (or rope, if you want to cheat)
        Somewhere safe and outdoors to start the fire (concrete driveway is fine)
        A knife (pocket knives are great)

  Warnings::
        This is literally playing with fire.  Do it outside, in a clean well ventilated area.
        Have a bucket of water or sand on standby, and make sure the area is away from combustible
        materials.  A fire extinguisher isn't recommended, due to the high pressures involved being able to blow
        flaming combustion around - better to douse in sand or water.
        Make sure there's no large winds or other factors that might precipitate disaster.
        If you've never made a campfire before, practice first, to get an idea of how to stack kindling
        to make a fire, and how to properly contain a small fire.

  Options::
        Consider first demonstrating with matches, to get the safety protocol clear.
        Also consider demonstrating some alternative methods, which are spelled out below (TODO : spell out below)
        It can be helpful to make a fun goal at the end to stimulate interest (I recommend toasting a marshmallow!)

  Method::
        Safety first, make sure the area you're making fire in is clear from debris, away from combustible materials.

        A basic bow drill is using a rapidly spinning bit of wood (the drill) to cause a huge friction in another
        part of wood, such that an ember is formed.
        Transferring the ember to kindling and applying air flow (blowing on it) is how the fire is actually made.

        Preparing your materials::
            Take the green stick and bend it to form a semicircular bow-like shape.

            Fix the cord to either end, such that the stick can no longer go straight,
            but not so tight that you could use it to fire an arrow.  A little slack is what you're after.

            Take the dowel, and ensure the ends are rounded and not square, by trimming it a bit with the knife.
            It doesn't have to be perfect, you're just looking to remove the right angles
            and make it fit easier into the joints.

            Take the dowel, and wrap the cord from the bow around it a turn or two.  The bow and cord
            should grip the dowel, such that when you move the bow perpendicular
            to the dowel, the dowel spins when fixed.

            Take a piece of the dry timber (we'll call it the top holder), and cut a circular notch
            in the middle.  This is to hold the top of the spinning dowel.  Make sure the notch is wider
            than the dowel diameter, so it doesn't slip when under tension.

            Take another piece of the dry timber, and cut a circular notch all the way through.  The notch
            should be close to the edge, and open on the side to allow air flow.  This is the base piece,
            where the ember will be formed.  Ensure the notch is smaller than the dowel diameter, as it'll
            need to notch into this joint in order to create friction.

            Create a larger bunch of cotton wool to receive the hot ember, and a further small pile of kindling
            to receive the flaming ball of cotton wool.

        Making the actual fire::
            Place the base timber onto a wider piece of timber.  You'll use the wider piece to transfer the hot ember
            into the cotton wool once it's hot.

            Place a small piece of the cotton wool into the lower notch of the base piece of timber, to help
            creating the ember.

            Take the dowel-with-bow, place one end of the dowel into the base piece, and hold the top
            with the top holder.  When you move the bow, the dowel should spin and cause friction with the lower
            section of wood.

            Proceed to move the bow back and forwards, creating friction and causing hot shavings to fall into
            the cotton wool.

            Once you've got a noticeable ember, quickly transfer it into the larger pile of cotton wool,
            and blow on it to encourage combustion.  This may take a few tries to get it right.

            Once it's burning, quickly transfer it to the prepared pile of kindling.  At this point, you've
            got yourself a campfire.  Engage marshmallows on sticks, and marvel at your new ability to do what
            no other species on the planet has figured out yet.
